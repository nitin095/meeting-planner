### 2) User Authorization system -
a) User can be of two roles, normal and admin. Admin should be identified
with a username ending with "admin", like "alex-admin" is an admin, since
it ends with "admin".

### 3) User Slots management system (Flow for normal User) -
a) Upon login, normal User should be taken to a dashboard showing his
current months', planned meetings, in the form of a calendar. Current
day-cell should be selected by default.

b) User should be able to only view his meeting slots and he should not be
able to make any changes
Hint - you may use calendar modules of Angular to design the Interface. One
such module which you can use for calendar UI is Angular-Calendar.

### 4) User Slots management system (Flow for Admin User)-
a) Upon login, admin User should be taken to a dashboard, showing all
normal users in a list format

b) Upon clicking on any user, admin should be taken to user's current
calendar, with current date selected, by default.

c) Admin should be able to add/delete/update meetings on any day, by
clicking on a appropriate day-cell/timeline.

d) These details should be stored in database for every user.

### 5) User Alerts management system
a) Normal User should also be notified in real time, though an alert if he is
online, and email (irrespective of whether he is online or offline), when

  i) A meeting is created by admin
  
  ii) A meeting is changed by admin
  
  iii) 1 minute before meeting, with an option to snooze or dismiss. If
  snoozed, alert should come again in 5 seconds, if snoozed again, it
  should re-appear in next 5 seconds and so on. Once dismissed,
  alert should no longer appear.

### 6) Planner Views
a) Similar to Google or outlook calendars.

b) The view must follow the following guidelines -

  i) Planner should show only current year, past and future years to be
  ignored.
  
  ii) User should be able to change months, through an arrow button(or
  prev/next button), each month should show all the dates in tabular
  format, like in actual calendar.
  
  iii) Day Cells should be filled, if any meeting is kept, with a some
  design. There should also be a design for overlapping meetings.
  
  iv) Upon click the day's cell, a view should pop, showing all meetings,
  along a 24 hr timeline, with the slots covering the exact duration of
  each meeting.
  
  v) Upon clicking on a meeting, its details should pop up in another
  view

c) Admin Flow:

  i) For admin, a create button should be there in calendar view, to
  create a meeting.
  
  ii) Upon clicking on create button, details view should open.
  
  iii) Once created, it should appear on the calendar view.
  
  iv) Upon clicking on an already created meeting, same details view
  should open.
  
  v) Details view should be a form
  
  vi) Admin should be able to make changes in meeting details form,
  and submit.
  
  vii) Admin should be able to delete a meeting as well, with another
  button
  
  viii) Meeting details, should cover when, where and purpose. Also, by
  default username of the admin, who kept the meeting, should also
  show in non-editable format.


### 7) Error Views and messages - You have to handle each major error response
(like 404 or 500) with a different page. Also, all kind of errors, exceptions and
messages should be handled properly on frontend. The user should be aware all
the time on frontend about what is happening in the system.
